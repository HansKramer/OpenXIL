XIL Open Source Distribution
----------------------------


What is XIL?
-----------

XIL is an imaging library, originally developed by Sun Microsystems for 
the Solaris operating system. It provides a C API for use by
programmers developing imaging applications. Its name to the contrary,
XIL is not part of the X window system, although it does interact with X.


Why is Sun releasing the XIL source code?
----------------------------------------

XIL is being removed from the Solaris operating system in favor
of a cross-platform Java-based API, Java Advanced Imaging. See

   http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/

Not all applications are ready or able to migrate to Java. For those
applications which can operate in a platform-native environment, XIL
can provide a viable image processing solution. Making the source code
available provides an optional strategy for applications which must
continue to depend on XIL.


What can XIL do for me?
-----------------------

XIL is a performance-oriented image processing library. It provides
full support for image tiling, allowing very large images to be 
processed with modest memory resources. It is also MT-Hot,
transparently making use of multiple processors to accelerate image
processing.

A basic part of XIL's architecture is the ability to provide
transparent hardware acceleration which uses special capabilities
of framebuffers or processors. This is accomplished via a pluggable
"pipeline" architecture, allowing already deployed user code to gain
improved performance. 

Full information about XIL's capabilities can be found at
    http://www.sun.com/software/imaging/XIL/xil.html


What platforms does XIL support?
--------------------------------

The source code being released has been built and tested on
Solaris/sparc, Solaris/Intel and Linux/Intel. Previous binary releases
were distributed on this site for other OS'es, notably Windows NT 4.0.
However, due to time and resource constraints, the Win32 version has
not been built and tested for this current release.

Frankly, developing Win32 libraries is not a core competency in the XIL
group. However, the results of previous porting  efforts are reflected
in the source base. There IS Windows-specific code in the source tree,
and a working Win32 version has been built in the past. Someone in the
developer community who is more Windows-savvy (or Windows-motivated)
should be able to get XIL to build and run in a Windows environment.


What can I do with XIL?
-----------------------

Pretty much anything you please as long as you follow the requirements
in the license agreement. We've tried to model it roughly on the
Mozilla Public License. Specifically, its not GPL'ed, so you can use it
in you own product without having to open up everything.
